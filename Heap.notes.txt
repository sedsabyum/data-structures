Heaps:
	Heaps are another type of Trees
	What applies to trees also relevant to heaps, but there are other rules and considerations
	
Binary Heaps: 
	Similar to a binary search trees, but with some different rules
	Unlike BST there is no order to the left versus the right
	Used to implement Priority Queues, which are very commonly used data structures 
	Used quite a bit, with graph traversal algorithms
	MaxBinaryHeap:
		Each parent has at most two child nodes
		Parent nodes are always greater than child nodes
		No implied ordering between siblings
		As compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be
		Left children are filled out first
	MinBinaryHeap:
		(...MaxBinaryHeap)
		Parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes
	Relation(Parent to childs):
		n -> (2n + 1); (2n + 2)
